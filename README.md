# Python_notes
A new project for making python learning content
having some git and github issues need to figure out. multiple git ids and githubs to wrangle into submission

fixed, checked git email, fixed and had to pull before pushing for some reason.
not fixed. still connecting it with my work git instead of personal git.
ended up resolving issue ussing github desktop app to associate proper git id to github
test test, had to use other that matched email
