    <h2>Internet and the World Wide Web</h2>
    <h3>What is the Internet</h3>
    <p>
      A common misconception is that the internet and the world wide web are the
      same thing. No, they are not. They are two completely different
      technologies that work together. This pairing enables a lot of our smart
      devices and technology to be able to work and connect with other smart
      devices and technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      First off, the internet existed before the world wide web. The internet is
      a global network that interlinks different devices together. Your
      computer, smart phone, tablet or any other internet capable device (your
      refrigerator, doorbell) connects to the internet with a unique identifier
      and working usually with transmission control protocol/internet protocol
      (TCP/IP) . This makes the device able to send and receive email, text
      messages and other communication using internet protocols. In the early
      days of the internet, before smart phones and advanced devices, all this
      was done through simple computer terminals with dedicated applications for
      each task. Simple terminals served as clients that would communicate
      through the internet to more powerful servers. This was how it was until
      the next digital revolution arrived to take advantage of this
      infrastructure
    </p>
    <h3>What is World Wide Web</h3>
    <p>
      Tim Berners-Lee, a CERN scientist who wanted to share information with
      other scientists, using an existing technology called SGML, Standard
      Generalized Markup Language, he created HTML, Hyper Text Markup Language.
      Alongside the HTTP (hyper text transfer protocol) to be used on the
      internet, with a web browser, a user could now easily connect to vast
      amounts of resources and as time passed, new technologies came and went.
      Web sites and browsers evolved or faded away. CSS came to make it pretty
      and JavaScript came to make programmable. Browsers and websites now handle
      a variety of tasks and activities that previously required dedicated
      hardware and complicated applications.
    </p>
    <h2>HTML Information</h2>
    <h3>Useful but not important</h3>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, it was created by a scientist to share information.
      Worth mentioning because that answers a lot of why HTML is the way it
      is. Open and free and has some quirks.
    </p>
    <h3>HTML Breakdown</h3>
    <p>
      The first piece of Front End Web Development. Simply put, HTML is the 
      content marked up or identified. HTML is a file format that follows structural rules in order to
      be rendered/displayed by a browser. You identify/markup/tag your content
      with HTML so the browser will know what to do with it. Tags will identify
      your headingss, paragrapphs, links, images and other necessary information
      it needs to provide to the browser. Tags are made up of a less than
      symbol, the tag name and ending with a greater than. For example, the
      create an opening paragraph tag, you would have &lt;p&gt;. In order for
      that to appear appropriately in a browser, the less than and greater than
      html codes were used instead of the keyboard less than.

    </p>
    <h2>CSS Information</h2>
    <h3>Why CSS?</h3>
    <p>
      Short answer, HTML is not pretty. It was not meant to be. Remember, a
      scientist who wasn't concerned about how it looked but more focused on the
      content. Early web developers concerned with aesthetics tried all sorts of
      clever hacks and tricks. Using tables and slicing up images for layout was
      what it took before the invention of CSS. Cascading Style Sheets
    </p>
    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets is another technology we use to dictate/apply rules
      to HTML content. With CSS, you can specify what colors to use, what typeface,
      size, positiong and many other properties that deal with aesthetics.
    </p>
    <h3>Why is it called CSS?</h3>
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets refer to cascading water falls. Water flows down to
      the lowest level and so does CSS. At the top-most level, style sheets,
      separate files that web pages could link to. Followed by on a lower tier,
      embedded styles, style rules contained in the head area of the particular
      web page to affect. And the final level, inline style, at the lowest level
      where the style rule is in the opening of the html tag. The rules flow
      downward, cascade from the top down to the bottom, combining the rules if
      there are no conflicts and applying the last rule if rules do conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since different browsers and devices have different defaults, a good
      practice is to reset the css to the same initial values in the beginning.

    <p>We stand on the shoulders of giants. Thank you!</p>
    <p>
      Words to learn in this language are the different selectors (as the name
      implies, selects the html element/elements you want to modify, many many
      properties (the aesthetic you want to affect, color, size, position) and
      the possible values to apply to that particular property. For example, the
      CSS Rule below assigns the blue value to the color property of the h1
      element (since that was used as the selector)
    </p>
    <code> &NonBreakingSpace;h1 { color: blue;}&NonBreakingSpace; </code>
    <p>
      Just like any language, CSS is fussy about syntax and structure. How to
      set the appropriate selectors can be a challenge in itself in conjunction
      with HTML to identify and classify sections and divs within the HTML page.
      The rule syntax is as follows, within the set of curly braces associated
      with the selector, the name of the property followed by a colon. The colon
      is then followed by an appropriate value or even multiple (appropriate)
      values for the property.
    </p>
    <h2>Javascript</h2>
    <h3>What is it and whats up with the name?</h3>
    <p>
      Javascript or JS is the third member of the trio of technology we call
      Front End Web Development. It was created over a weekend and has matured
      over the 30 plus years it has been around. Simply put, it provides HTML
      the ability to respond to user interaction on the browser. Without JS, on
      the browser/client side, HTML would be limited to its own functionality
      such as links and CSS animations and nothing else. Anything more
      complicated would have to be handled back on the web server with another
      programming language such as PERL, PHP, CGI, Java, Coldfusion or something
      more recent. Nowadays, in modern web development, you can even have
      Javascript running on the server. In fact, Javascript provides the
      capability to update/modify a part of the web page without having to
      refresh the entire page.
    </p>
    <h3>Why use it</h3>
    <p>
      "Classic" Web development that was in the beginning had fairly static
      content that was contained in separate HTML files. A single click would
      connect to a web server and retrieve a whole new page. Modern Web
      Development usually focuses on Single Page Applications where you keep the
      same page and using Javascript, update/modify the DOM to change only what
      needs to update instead of updating the entire page everytime.
